## Grow Your Own Pixel Plant

Description:
A series of flowers, each with a randomly generated number of petals, simulate the game ["he loves me, he loves me not."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_loves_me..._he_loves_me_not)
 One flower is displayed at a time. Petals are picked off one-by-one, and a corresponding message of “[he, she, they, I] loves me” or “[he, she, they, I] loves me not” is shown, culminating in a final answer when the last petal is picked off.
